├── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks documenting the project steps
├── results/           # Visual outputs from analysis
```

## Key Features
- Data Collection: API integration and web scraping to gather SpaceX launch data.
- Data Wrangling: Preprocessing and cleaning datasets for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations using SQL and Python.
- Machine Learning: Predicting launch outcomes using classification models.
- Dash App: Interactive dashboard for visualizing launch data.

## Requirements
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Dash App
1. Navigate to the `app/` directory:
   ```
   cd app
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python spacex_dash_app.py
   ```

## Files
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each module.
- `datasets/`: Includes CSV files used in the project.
- `results/`: Contains images of visual outputs.
- `app/`: Dash app scripts for interactive visualizations.

## Credits
This project is part of the Coursera Data Science Capstone course.
